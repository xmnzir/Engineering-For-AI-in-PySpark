# Engineering-For-AI-in-PySpark
A PySpark-based data pipeline for cleaning, enriching, and summarising NYC Taxi trip data. The project processes raw taxi trip records, joins them with NYC zones, computes profitability metrics, and ranks zones by trip activity and performance, while also benchmarking execution times across dataset sizes.
